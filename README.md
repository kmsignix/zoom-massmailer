[SIGNiX](https://www.signix.com/) digital signature platform has MassMailer feature for distributing documents and forms and collecting data and signatures


## Description
This project contains files for a showcase and tutorial of the SIGNiX MassMailer feature.

There are two demonstrations included. One is for collecting data from lessees of Zoom Jet Packs,
a fictional company that is required to collect insurance details on an annual basis. The other is
for Zoom Jet Packs to distribute an important recall notice, and to track which customers have 
opened and acknowledged it.

## About MassMailer
MassMailer is a feature to create transactions in volume. Capabilities include:
* Distribute documents and forms
* Personalize / prepopulate forms for each transaction (similar to Mail Merge)
* Collect signatures and signed documents / forms
* Collect data via forms (and downloaded in aggregate)
* Track the completion of transactions via a dashboard

MassMailer is a no-code solution. It is driven entirely through the SIGNiX MyDoX UI.

MassMailer is a user-driven feature with a complete UI. It is CSV-driven, so data is easy to
prepare in Excel or with a database. Results can be processed in Excel, offering all the data
collected via forms.

Documents and forms are in PDF format. SIGNiX provides an interactive editor, for adding
form fields and signature fields to PDFs. The form fields can be prepopulated from the input
CSV, or used to collect data from signers.
